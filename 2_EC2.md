# EC2 Overview

## Summary

- **Instance:** AMI (OS), instance size (cpu/ram), storage, security groups, user data
- **SG:** Firewall attached to EC2
- **User Data:** Script launched first time instance is spun up
- **SSH:** Secure access to ec2 instance
- **Purchasing Options:**
  - **On demand:** PAYG, predictable pricing
  - **Spot:** Short workloads, wrkloads resilient to failure
  - **Reserved:**
    - **Standard:** Long workloads (min 1 yr, max 3 yr)
    - **Convertible:** Same as standard, except insatnces are flexible
    - **Scheduled:** Specific times eg. every Thu 7Pm to 9PM
  - **Dedicated Host:** (3 yr commitment) Physical server with EC2 capacity fully dedicated to you. Good for compliance requirements and allows use of server-bound software licences.
  - **Dedicated Instance:** Instances run on hardware dedicated to you. Can sahre with other instances on same account. no control over instance placement - no access to underlying hardware.

# EC2 Instance Storage

## Summary

- **EBS:**
  - Network drivres attach to one instance at a time
  - Mapped to AZ
  - Can use EBS snapshot to backup/ transfer across AZ
- **AMI:** Create ready to use EC2 instances with customizations
- **EC2 Image Builder:** Auto build, test and distribute AMI
- **Instance Store:** High performance disk attached to EC2. Lost if instance stopped.
- **EFS:** Network foile system, can be attached to 100s of instances
- **EFS-IA:** cost-optimized storage class for infrequent accessed files
- **FSx for Windows:** Network file system for Windows servers
- **FSx for Lustre:** high performance computing Linux file system
